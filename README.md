# EchoDepths

**EchoDepths** is a dungeon-crawler game that focuses on demonstrating enemy AI decision-making models. The project aims to showcase different implementations of artificial intelligence within the game. The player's goal is to collect loot and exit the dungeon alive.

## The following models will be used:

The list of AI models ***may*** be expanded in the future.
